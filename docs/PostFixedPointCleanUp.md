# Post-Fixed-Point Cleanup

**Date:** March 17, 2025
**Context:** After achieving bootstrap fixed-point (Opus.md), several sessions
improved the self-hosted lowerer. This document captures the current state and
remaining cleanup tasks.

---

## Current State

### Test Suite

| Project | Tests | Status |
|---------|------:|--------|
| Codex.Core.Tests | 16 | ✅ |
| Codex.Syntax.Tests | 88 | ✅ |
| Codex.Ast.Tests | 11 | ✅ |
| Codex.Semantics.Tests | 15 | ✅ |
| Codex.Types.Tests | 529 | ✅ |
| Codex.Lsp.Tests | 18 | ✅ |
| Codex.Repository.Tests | 23 | ✅ |
| **Total** | **700** | **All pass** |

Build: zero errors, 2 warnings (both `CS8603` in `Codex.Codex.cs` — null
return in `main()`, expected from effect syntax gap).

### Bootstrap Pipeline

```
.codex source (21 files, ~143K chars)
  → Stage 0 (Codex.Cli, C# reference compiler)
  → out/Codex.Codex.cs (Stage 1 output, ~258K chars, 4,925 lines)
  → Codex.Bootstrap (uses Stage 1 as compiler)
  → stage1-output.cs (Stage 2 output, ~158K chars, 1,203 lines)
```

| Metric | Stage 0 output | Stage 2 output |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| `object` references | 5 (all legitimate) | 3 (all legitimate) |
| `_p0_` proxy params | 23 | 17 |
| Unification errors | 0 | 0 |
| ErrorTy bindings | 0 | 0 |
| Has-object bindings | 0 | 1 (`main` only) |

The 5 Stage 0 `object` references are: 1 string literal in `is_cs_keyword`,
2 in `cs_type` (`NothingTy`/`ErrorTy` → `"object"`), 2 in `main()` return.

The 3 Stage 2 `object` references are the same pattern minus the 2 `main()`
return variants (Stage 2 emits single-line bodies).

### Lowerer Fixes Applied (This Session)

1. **`binary-result-type` helper** — Binary ops now use left operand type
   (or `BooleanTy` for comparisons) instead of blindly propagating expected
   type. Fixes `(object remaining = ar - list_length(args))` patterns.

2. **If-expression type inference** — When expected type is `ErrorTy`,
   infers result from then-branch. Matches `Lowering.cs` lines 95–97.

3. **Match expression type inference** — `infer-match-type` scans branches
   for first non-`ErrorTy` body. Matches `Lowering.cs` line 351.

4. **ConstructedTy field access** — Resolves through constructor type to
   find underlying `RecordTy` for field type lookup.

5. **Per-field record lowering** — `lower-record-fields-typed` looks up
   each field's expected type from the `RecordTy` instead of passing the
   whole record type to every field.

### What Opus.md Listed vs Current State

| Opus Item | Was | Now | Status |
|-----------|-----|-----|--------|
| 90 `object` lines | 90 | **3** (Stage 2), **5** (Stage 0) | ✅ Fixed — all remaining are legitimate |
| 17 `_p0_` proxy lines | 17 | **17** (Stage 2), **23** (Stage 0) | ⚠️ Cosmetic — partial application wrappers, C# infers types |
| Byte-for-byte convergence | No | No | ⚠️ Stage 0 (4,925 lines) vs Stage 2 (1,205 lines) — different formatting |
| Effect annotations | Missing | **Fixed** | ✅ Parser skips `[Console]` effect syntax, 0 unification errors |

---

## Remaining Tasks

### Tier 1: Correctness

**1. ~~Effect annotation parsing~~** ✅ — Fixed. `parse-effect-type` in
`Parser.codex` skips `[...]` effect brackets and parses the return type.
Self-hosted compiler now has 0 unification errors (was 1).

**2. Verify Stage 2 compiles as C#** — Stage 2 output (`stage1-output.cs`)
needs to be tested as a standalone C# program. Currently it is written out
by `Codex.Bootstrap` but not compiled. Create a test that builds it with
`dotnet build` and verifies zero errors.

### Tier 2: Convergence

**3. Emission format alignment** — Stage 0 emits multi-line method bodies
(4,925 lines). Stage 2 emits single-line expression bodies (1,205 lines).
True fixed-point requires identical output. Options:
- Make the C# reference emitter match the self-hosted style (expression bodies)
- Make the self-hosted emitter match Stage 0 style (statement bodies)
- Accept semantic equivalence without byte-for-byte match
Damian Says: we don't need byte for byte.  we need semantic equivalence.
- 
**4. Type declaration ordering** — The reference compiler emits record types
before sum types; the self-hosted compiler may emit them in definition order.
The `generated-output/*/mini-bootstrap.*` files show this ordering difference
across all 10 non-IL backends. Harmless but prevents exact diff.

### Tier 3: Polish

**5. `_p0_` proxy parameter names** — 17–23 lines use `_p0_`, `_p1_` as
lambda parameter names from partial application wrapping. These work because
C# infers the types from context, but they're ugly. Fix: in the emitter,
when generating partial application wrappers, look up the target function's
parameter types and emit typed lambdas like `(Expr _p0_) => ...`.

**6. Generated output corpus refresh** — The `generated-output/` directory
has 10 changed `mini-bootstrap.*` files (type declaration ordering). These
should be regenerated and committed to match the current compiler output:
```
codex build samples/mini-bootstrap.codex --targets cs,js,rust,py,cpp,go,java,ada,fortran,cobol
```

### Tier 4: Ecosystem

**7. VS 2022 extension (VSIX)** — `tools/Codex.VsExtension/` has:
- ✅ TextMate grammar (`codex.tmLanguage.json`) with all keywords
- ✅ Language configuration (brackets, auto-close, indentation)
- ✅ `.pkgdef` registration
- ✅ `build-vsix.ps1` and `install-vs.ps1` scripts
- ✅ `codex.project.json` schema
- ⚠️ Not verified against current VS 2022 version
- ⚠️ `Codex.VsExtension.csproj.Backup*.tmp` files should be cleaned

**8. VS Code extension** — `editors/vscode/` has:
- ✅ TextMate grammar (synced with VS 2022 version)
- ✅ Language configuration
- ✅ LSP client (`src/extension.ts`)
- ✅ `node_modules` present (dependencies installed)
- ⚠️ Not verified against current VS Code version
- ⚠️ `VSCODE-SETUP.md` in `docs/` — verify instructions still work

**9. LSP server** — `src/Codex.Lsp/` provides:
- ✅ Diagnostics (errors + warnings in editor)
- ✅ Hover (type information)
- ✅ Completion
- ✅ Go-to-definition
- ✅ Document symbols
- ✅ Semantic tokens
- 18 tests all passing
- ⚠️ Not tested with the new lowerer changes (shouldn't affect LSP since
  LSP uses the reference compiler pipeline, not the self-hosted one)

**10. IL emitter** — `src/Codex.Emit.IL/` handles integers, text, booleans,
numbers, static methods, if/else, let bindings, binary ops, function calls,
records, sum types, field access, pattern matching. Produces runnable `.exe`.
- ⚠️ Missing: generics, TCO, full bootstrap
- ⚠️ No integration tests in the test suite (tests were in a separate run)

**11. Babbage emitter** — `src/Codex.Emit.Babbage/` is the Analytical Engine
backend. Intentionally limited. No action needed.

### Tier 5: Documentation

**12. Update `08-MILESTONES.md`** — M13 still shows `[ ] Stage 1 output =
Stage 2 output (full bootstrap fixed-point verification)` as unchecked.
The functional fixed-point is achieved (Stage 2 compiles, types resolve
correctly). Whether to check this off depends on whether "=" means
byte-for-byte or semantic equivalence.

**13. Update `FORWARD-PLAN.md`** — The "Bootstrap Status" section (lines
109–142) has stale numbers (328 `object`, 1,863 unification errors). Update
to reflect current state: 3 `object`, 1 error.

**14. Opus.md addendum** — Consider appending a section on the post-fixed-
point work: lowerer type inference (binary, if, match), `object` count
reduction from 90 → 3.

## Backends Audit (from Emitter Status commit `fbe227c`)

All 12 backends were audited in a prior session. Summary:

| Backend | Records | Sum Types | Match | Recursion | Effects | Status |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|--------|
| C# | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Clean |
| JavaScript | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Clean |
| Python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Clean |
| Rust | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Clean |
| C++ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Clean |
| Go | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Clean |
| Java | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fixed: class name collision, `.apply()` |
| Ada | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fixed: procedure name collision |
| Fortran | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fixed: missing IRMatch, pattern vars |
| COBOL | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Fixed: missing IRMatch, var names |
| IL | ✅ | — | — | ✅ | — | Produces runnable `.exe`, limited |
| Babbage | — | — | — | — | — | Analytical Engine, intentionally limited |

The lowerer changes (binary-result-type, if/match inference) affect only the
self-hosted pipeline. The reference compiler's `Lowering.cs` already had
these behaviors, so the 10 mainstream backends are unaffected.

**One thing to verify:** Regenerate the `generated-output/` corpus and diff
against the committed versions. The only expected differences are the type
declaration ordering in `mini-bootstrap.*` (already visible in `git diff`).
