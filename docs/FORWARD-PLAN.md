## Where We Are

The Codex compiler is self-hosting. The full pipeline works:

```
Source (.codex) → Lex → Parse → Desugar → NameResolve → TypeCheck → Lower → Emit → dotnet/node/rustc/...
```

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| C# projects | 31 |
| Test count | 628 (all passing) |
| Codex source | ~2,600 lines across 21 .codex files |
| Bootstrap parity | ~286 records, ~310 functions in output.cs |
| Backends | C#, JavaScript, Rust, Python, C++, Go, Java, Ada, Babbage, Fortran, COBOL (11 total) |
| LSP | Diagnostics, hover, completion, go-to-definition, symbols, semantic tokens |
| Repository | Content-addressed fact store with proposals/verdicts, import resolution |
| IDE support | TextMate grammar for VS 2022 + VS Code |
| Build system | Incremental builds, parallel front-end, parallel multi-target emission |
| Prose | Chapter/Section structure, prose templates (record & variant from bullet lists) |
| Parser | Error recovery: partial definitions, partial types, bad fields/constructors skipped |

## What's Next (Priority Order)

### Tier 1: Solidify What Exists

**1. Error recovery in parser** — ✅ Done.
Parser now recovers from errors at all levels: type definitions produce
`ErrorTypeBody` instead of backtracking, definitions with missing `=`
produce partial `DefinitionNode` with `ErrorExpressionNode`, record bodies
skip bad fields, variant bodies skip bad constructors. Multiple definitions
after errors are parsed correctly. 11 new tests. New diagnostic codes:
CDX1050 (bad type body), CDX1051 (bad record field), CDX1052 (bad variant ctor).

### Tier 2: Complete Partial Milestones

**1. Effect handlers (M5)**
`run-state` and user-defined effect handlers. The effect system already has
row variables for polymorphism — handlers need to eliminate effects from
the row. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md): "Direct I/O for Effects."
Estimated: medium-large.

**2. Views (M7)**
The repository stores facts and resolves imports, but there's no view layer.
A View maps names to definitions such that all definitions are mutually
consistent. Single-user views first, then multi-user consensus.
Estimated: medium.

**3. The Reader (M4)**
`codex read <file>` renders a prose-mode document to the terminal with
formatted prose, highlighted notation blocks, and structured layout.
`Codex.Narration` is the project for this — currently empty.
Estimated: small-medium.

**4. Type-level function reduction (M10)**
Proof steps that require unfolding function definitions currently use
`assume`. The proof checker needs to normalize type-level expressions
by inlining function bodies. Arithmetic induction with Peano encoding
also depends on this. Estimated: medium.

### Tier 3: New Capabilities

**5. Direct IL emission (`Codex.Emit.IL`) — native .exe without C# transpile**
The C# emitter produces text that must be fed to `dotnet build` to get an
executable. This means Codex always depends on the C# toolchain at build time.
A direct IL backend would emit a .NET PE assembly (`.exe` / `.dll`) from the
IR, skipping the C# intermediary entirely.

Pipeline today:
```
.codex → Lex → Parse → … → Lower → CSharpEmitter → .cs → dotnet build → .exe
```

Pipeline with IL emitter:
```
.codex → Lex → Parse → … → Lower → ILEmitter → .exe (directly)
```

**Approach:** Use `System.Reflection.Metadata` + `System.Reflection.PortableExecutable`
(both in-box in .NET 8) to write raw IL bytes and PE headers. This is the same
infrastructure Roslyn uses. No external dependencies.

**New project:** `src/Codex.Emit.IL/` implementing a new `IAssemblyEmitter`
interface (since `ICodeEmitter.Emit` returns `string`, and this returns `byte[]`
or writes to a stream).

**CLI integration:** `codex build . --target il` produces a runnable `.exe`
directly. The existing `--target cs` continues to work for transpile scenarios.

**Bootstrap significance:** Once the IL emitter can compile the full Codex
source, the compiler can produce its own `.exe` without any C# toolchain
dependency. That's the final step to true self-hosting — Codex compiles itself
to an executable with no external compiler involved.

**Incremental plan:**
1. Scaffold `Codex.Emit.IL` project, `IAssemblyEmitter` interface, wire into CLI
2. Emit a working `.exe` for a trivial `main = "Hello"` program
3. Emit static methods (the module class pattern the C# emitter uses)
4. Records and sum types (sealed record → IL class hierarchy)
5. Pattern matching (the `switch` dispatch the C# emitter generates → IL branch tables)
6. Generics (the C# emitter's generic function strategy → IL generic method defs)
7. Tail call optimization (IL `tail.` prefix or loop conversion)
8. Full bootstrap: `codex build codex-src --target il` produces `Codex.exe`

Estimated: large (steps 1–3 are medium; 4–8 are individually medium-large).

**6. Package manager / dependency resolution**
The repository stores facts but there's no transitive dependency resolution
across modules. `import` currently resolves one level deep — it needs to
resolve transitively, handle version conflicts, and support views.
Estimated: large.

**7. Full `Vector` type (M8)**
The dependent type infrastructure works. Wire it up end-to-end: `Vector n a`
with `append : Vector m a → Vector n a → Vector (m + n) a`, compile and run.
Estimated: medium.

## Resolved Questions

These were open questions. Damian answered them; decisions are recorded in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

### Language Design

1. **Module system** → **Prose-style imports (long-term).** The vision
   ([NewRepository.txt](Vision/NewRepository.txt)) describes capability-based
   prose imports: `I need: access to the filesystem to write files.` For now,
   `import TypeName` works as the notation-mode syntax and resolves from the
   repository's fact store. The prose-import design is an open question.

2. **Mutable state** → **Named-purpose mutability.** No general `ref` types.
   Mutable values must declare their purpose by naming convention —
   `UnificationState`, not `MutableRef`. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md):
   "Codex-Side Type Checker — Threaded UnificationState."

3. **Type classes / traits** → **No explicit type classes.** Polymorphism is
   the compiler's problem. Prose handles subtyping naturally. Design work needed.

4. **String interpolation** → **No.** `++` and named functions only.
   See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md): "No String Interpolation Syntax."

5. **Tail call optimization** → **✅ Done.** All 11 backends convert
   self-recursive tail calls to loops. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md):
   "Tail Call Optimization via Loop Conversion."

### Tooling

6. **CI pipeline** → **Deferred.** Not until there are users or funding.

7. **VS Code extension publishing** → **Deferred.** Same.

8. **Documentation generation** → **Deferred.** Low priority.

### Architecture

9. **Incremental compilation** → **✅ Done.** SHA256 content hash + timestamp.
   Parallel front-end, parallel emission. See M11c in the completed list above.

10. **Test preservation** → **Policy enforced.** Sample `.codex` files go in
    `samples/`, integration tests call the compiler on them. Every sample is
    a permanent regression test. Currently 628 tests across 7 test projects.

## Open Questions (Remaining)

1. **Prose-import syntax** — What exactly does a prose import look like?
   `I need: access to the filesystem` implies capability-based imports rather
   than module-based. How does this interact with the effect system?
   (See [NewRepository.txt](Vision/NewRepository.txt) Chapter 4.)

2. **Auto-memoization** — Which functions get memoized? All recursive pure
   functions? Only those marked? Only those with primitive arguments? What's
   the eviction policy? This needs a design doc before implementation.
   (See the Named-purpose mutability decision.)

3. **Subtype-inference for prose polymorphism** — "Add this fish to the list
   of animals" implies structural subtyping or coercion. Codex currently has
   nominal sum types. How do we bridge the gap?

4. **Heap-allocated stack frames** — For non-tail recursive functions, should
   we offer CPS transform + trampoline? TCO covers the tail-call case;
   this would cover general deep recursion.

## Technical Debt

| Item | Location | Impact | Effort | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Rust backend doesn't `.clone()` for recursive calls | `RustEmitter.cs` | Generated Rust won't compile for recursive `String`/`Vec` args (mitigated by TCO) | Medium | Open |
| JS uses `BigInt` (`42n`) for integers | `JavaScriptEmitter.cs` | Can't mix with `number` in arithmetic without explicit conversion | Low | Intentional |
| `output.cs` is tracked in git | `codex-src/output.cs` | Large generated file in version control | Low | Convenient for now |
| Iteration handoff docs are stale | `docs/ITERATION-*-HANDOFF.md` | 10 docs from old iteration model, superseded by this plan | Low | Archive or delete |
| `Codex.Narration` project is empty | `src/Codex.Narration/` | No prose rendering capability | Low | Deferred — see "The Reader (M4)" above |
| `TypeVariable emits as object` decision is superseded | `DECISIONS.md` | Superseded by "C# Generics for Polymorphic Functions" | None | Marked in DECISIONS.md |

## Principles (Unchanged)

See [10-PRINCIPLES.md](10-PRINCIPLES.md). The core principles haven't changed:

1. Ship working software at every milestone
2. Correctness over performance
3. Immutability by default
4. No premature abstraction
5. The human holds the vision; the tools serve the human
