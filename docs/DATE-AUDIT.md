# Date Audit — Hallucinated Dates in Agent-Generated Files

**Audit date**: 2026-03-18 (verified via system clock)
**Auditor**: Claude (Opus 4.6, Linux/claude.ai)

---

## Background

The Codex project began on or around **2026-03-13**. All iterations (1 through 13+)
occurred within a ~5-day window from 2026-03-13 through 2026-03-18. Previous agents
hallucinated dates from training data, placing some iterations in June 2025 — nearly
9 months before the project existed.

This audit catalogs every incorrect date found in agent-generated documents and
recommends corrections.

## Incorrect Dates Found

### Iteration Handoff Documents

| File | Current Date | Problem | Suggested Fix |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `docs/OldStatus/ITERATION-3-HANDOFF.md` | `2025-06-21` | 9 months before project existed | `2026-03-13` (estimated — check git log for commit `05a40ea`) |
| `docs/OldStatus/ITERATION-4-HANDOFF.md` | `2025-06-22` | 9 months before project existed | `2026-03-13` (estimated — check git log for commit `4c4b52e`) |

### Correct (or Plausible) Dates

These dates fall within the actual project timeline and appear correct:

| File | Date | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| `docs/OldStatus/ITERATION-5-HANDOFF.md` | `2026-03-14 Pi Day` | ✅ Plausible |
| `docs/OldStatus/ITERATION-7-HANDOFF.md` | `2026-03-14 Pi Day` | ✅ Plausible (multiple iterations per day) |
| `docs/OldStatus/ITERATION-9-HANDOFF.md` | `2026-03-15` | ✅ Plausible |
| `docs/OldStatus/ITERATION-11-HANDOFF.md` | `2026-03-15` | ✅ Plausible |
| `Opus.md` | `March 2026` | ✅ Correct (intentionally vague) |

### Decision Log (`docs/OldStatus/DECISIONS.md`)

| Decision | Current Date | Problem | Suggested Fix |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| "Direct I/O for Effects" | `2025-09 (M5)` | Pre-dates project | `2026-03-14` (M5 was Iteration 5) |
| "long/double Instead of BigInteger" | `2025-08 (M3)` | Pre-dates project | `2026-03-13` (M3 was Iteration 3) |
| Decisions marked `2026-03` | Various | ✅ Correct | No change needed |

### Missing Handoff Documents

The following iterations are referenced in git history but no handoff document was
found in the project knowledge. They may exist on disk or may not have been created:

- Iteration 1 (initial foundation)
- Iteration 2 (type checking)
- Iteration 6 (effects + linear types)
- Iteration 8 (LSP + editor)
- Iteration 10 (proofs)
- Iteration 12 (additional backends)
- Iteration 13 (self-hosting / bootstrap)

## How to Fix

### Option A: Correct in Place (Recommended)

For each wrong date, look up the actual commit timestamp from git:

```bash
# Find the real date for Iteration 3's commit
git log --format="%ai" 05a40ea -1

# Find the real date for Iteration 4's commit
git log --format="%ai" 4c4b52e -1
```

Then update the handoff documents with the real dates.

### Option B: Add Correction Notes

If preserving the original text is preferred, add a correction note at the top:

```markdown
> **Date correction**: The original date `2025-06-21` was hallucinated by the agent.
> The actual date of this work was `2026-03-13` based on git commit timestamps.
```

### For DECISIONS.md

The decision dates that say `2025-08` or `2025-09` should be updated to their actual
dates. The milestone numbers (M3, M5) are correct — only the year/month is wrong.

---

## Prevention

The `checkdate()` rule in `.github/agent-rules/00-META.md` prevents this from
recurring. All agents must query the system clock before writing dates.
