# Self-Host Parity Audit

## What parity means

See **principle 11 "Parity Is Narrow"** in `docs/10-PRINCIPLES.md`. Briefly:
the reference compiler (`src/`) is a **baseline**, not a mirror. The self-host
(`Codex.Codex/`) is expected to be a strict superset — doing more, doing
better, diverging on shape.

The parity requirement is narrow and sharp. Only things that affect the
**compilation output** must mirror precisely — lexing, parsing, desugaring,
type checking, lowering, codegen semantics. Two compilers operating on the
same source must reach the same program; `pingpong.sh` is the acceptance
test.

Things that only change what a human reads on the console — diagnostic
wording, error formatting, span precision, CLI output, debug dumps,
profiler output, build-time telemetry — are free to diverge. The self-host
can innovate or lag on this axis without violating the contract.

When the line is contested: ask "does this affect what a conforming program
can legally be, or what bytes it compiles to?" If yes, mirror. If no,
diverge freely.

## How to read this inventory

This document is the running inventory of where the two compilers stand on
the output-affecting axis. Green rows are in parity, yellow rows are
partially there, red rows are open gaps, and every row has a note so
future-Hex doesn't trip over the same rake twice.

Rows in the UX/diagnostics area are tracked only when a precision
difference is operationally load-bearing (e.g., a span offset that tooling
parses); otherwise they're out of scope.

### Data structures

| Item | Reference | Self-host | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| `List` | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | Mutable-via-heap-top, geometric growth, `list-set-at` in-place (post-P1) |
| `TextSet` (sorted) | ✓ | ✓ `Core/Set.codex` | ✅ | O(log n) contains, O(n) insert. Used by NameResolver dup-check |
| `HamtMap` | ✓ | ✓ `Core/Hamt.codex` | ✅ | 8192-slot open addressing; text + integer keys; used at link-time func-offset lookup (P5) |
| `Maybe` / `Option` | ✓ stdlib | ❌ | ❌ | Exists in `foreword/Maybe.codex` but self-host compiler code does not use it. Callers work around via sentinel pairs. |
| `LinkedList` | ✓ | 🟡 | 🟡 | Type exists; `record-set` builtin + O(1) text-chunks mutation landed (`827ce6e`). Need audit of call sites. |
| `Queue` / `Stack` | ✓ stdlib | ❌ in self-host | ❌ | `foreword/Queue.codex` present but compiler does not consume it |
| `StringBuilder` | ✓ stdlib | ❌ in self-host | ❌ | Per-char `acc ++ char-to-text c` quadratic pattern (P10/P11) was fixed via chunked accumulation rather than introducing a StringBuilder abstraction |
| `Pair` | ✓ stdlib | 🟡 ad-hoc | 🟡 | `foreword/Pair.codex` exists; self-host uses per-purpose 2-field records |
| `TextSearch` (trie) | ✓ stdlib | ❌ in self-host | ❌ | `foreword/TextSearch.codex` present but unused |
| Flat buffer / mutable memory | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | Bare-metal heap, bump allocator, `heap-save` / `heap-advance` (documented) |

### Primitives & runtime

| Item | Reference | Self-host | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| `Integer` (64-bit) | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | `IntegerTy`, wraps modulo 2⁶⁴ |
| `Number` / float | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | Distinct `NumberTy` / `FloatTy` in TypeEnv, IRChapter, CodexType. Runtime conversion lives on .NET only (see BACKLOG item 5). |
| `Text` / `String` (CCE) | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | CCE internal encoding; Unicode conversion only at I/O |
| `Character` | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | |
| `Boolean` | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | |
| Bitwise: `bit-and`, `bit-or`, `bit-xor`, `bit-shl`, `bit-shr`, `bit-not` | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | Full pipeline: TypeEnv, NameResolver, CSharpEmitter, X86_64 codegen (landed around `211dea3`, `b4f9f4b`) |
| Arithmetic: `abs`, `min`, `max`, `mod`, `div` negative-semantics | ✓ | 🟡 | 🟡 | Builtins exist; negative-operand mod/div semantics have not been re-verified against reference |
| CCE-ordered comparison on `Text` | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ | |

### Diagnostics & error reporting

| Item | Reference | Self-host | Status | Notes |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| `Diagnostic` record (severity, code, message, span) | ✓ | ✓ `Core/Diagnostic.codex` | ✅ | |

| Bare-metal BINARY-DIAG mode with per-stage PH markers | n/a | ✓ | ✅ | Emit-side (`02b71e9`, `8250b89`, `04b5c26`) |
| `let`-bind on effectful value rejected (CDX2033) | ✓ | ✓ | 🟡 | Ref emits diagnostic at `binding.Value.Span`; self-host uses `synthetic-span` (`add-unify-error` takes no span). Landed on `hex-hex/fix-let-effectful-bind` — fix commit `1b49158`, repro `samples/let-effectful-bug.codex`. Follow-up: thread binding span through `add-unify-error` in self-host so the diagnostic points at the offending line. |
| Parser error recovery (skip-to-next-def resync) | ✓ | ❌ | ❌ | Bag captures what it can; cascading failures still happen on malformed input. **Open gap.** |

## What landed since this audit was first written

Rather than bury the diff, here's the headline: the **entire diagnostics
Phase 1-5 stack** (DiagnosticBag, Severity, Phase, TextFormat, CdxCodes,
SourceSpan with file-id, parser bag, staged error gates, BINARY-DIAG mode),
**all six bitwise ops**, **HAMT and TextSet in `Core/`**, and the **full
runtime fast-path set** (`++`, `::`, `list-set-at`, `list-snoc`) are all in
parity now. That's the bulk of the originally-identified gaps.

The P1-P17 n² hotspot hunt (see `docs/BACKLOG.md` Performance section)
closed 11 of 17 entries; the remaining six (P2, P3, P7, P9, P14, P13-tail)
are documented as lower-order wins.

## Top open gaps (priority order)

1. **CPU-exception ISRs with serial register dump** — self-host bare-metal
   emitter now dumps `!EXC=<vec> RIP=<hex>` and halts on vec<32 (`hex/cpu-exception-isrs`).
   Remaining: (a) add error-code, R10, RSP; (b) decide whether to backport
   to reference so pingpong's ELF also gets diagnostics.
2. **Parser error recovery (skip-to-next-def resync)** — bag captures
   what it can, but one malformed def still cascades. Classic technique:
   on parse error, skip tokens until column-1 `name :` pattern, resume.
3. **Self-host adoption of foreword `Maybe`** — the library exists; the
   compiler doesn't use it. Low urgency (sentinel pairs work) but would
   reduce API surprise across stdlib boundary.
4. **Parameterized records through C# emit path** — reference chokes;
   self-host behaviour unconfirmed. Needs a focused test.
5. **Arithmetic semantics on negative operands** — `mod` / `div` edge
   cases not re-verified after recent changes.

## Not in scope

- Actually implementing every row (each is follow-up work per ticket)
- Making self-host byte-identical to reference (it's allowed to diverge)
- Rewriting the reference (it's frozen)

## How to keep this current

When a gap is closed or a new one found:
- Flip the row's status and add the closing commit SHA or a short note.
- If a new data structure or runtime behaviour is introduced in either
  compiler, add a row.
- Don't let this doc rot. Every "why doesn't X work" session should start
  by checking here, and end by updating here.
