## What Was Done

### Milestone Status

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| M0: Foundation | ✅ Complete | Project structure, core primitives, build passes |
| M1: Hello Notation | ✅ Complete | Lexer, parser, CST, AST, desugarer, all notation mode |
| M2: Type Checking | ✅ Complete | Name resolution, bidirectional type checker, unification |
| M3: Execution via C# | ✅ Complete | IR, lowering, C# emitter, `codex build`, `codex run` |
| **M4: Prose Integration** | **✅ Complete** | **ProseParser, chapter/section/prose/notation blocks, `codex read`, prose demo** |

### New Code This Iteration

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `src/Codex.Syntax/ProseParser.cs` | Prose-mode parser: splits source into chapters, prose blocks, and notation blocks; delegates notation to standard Lexer+Parser |
| `src/Codex.Syntax/SyntaxNodes.cs` | Added `ChapterNode`, `SectionNode`, `ProseBlockNode`, `NotationBlockNode`, `DocumentMember` base; updated `DocumentNode` to hold both flat definitions and chapters |
| `tools/Codex.Cli/Program.cs` | Added `codex read` command, `ParseSourceFile` prose-auto-detection helper, `PrintMembers`/`RenderMembers` for debug/formatted output |
| `samples/prose-greeting.codex` | Prose-mode demo: Chapter + prose + notation, compiles and runs to `Hello, World!` |
| `tests/Codex.Syntax.Tests/ProseParserTests.cs` | 10 tests: prose detection, chapter parsing, prose+notation mixing, desugarer round-trip |
| `tests/Codex.Types.Tests/IntegrationTests.cs` | 9 end-to-end tests: full pipeline from source to C# emission for notation and prose programs |

### Bug Fixes / Cleanup This Iteration

1. **Let-in lowering triple-lowering** — Rewrote `Lowering.LowerLet` to do a single pass: lower each binding in order, add to local env, lower the body, wrap in nested `IRLet`s. Was doing the work three times.
2. **Stripped all `///` XML doc comments** from all source files. Updated `copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to codify "no XML doc comments" as a rule.
3. **`.gitignore`** updated to exclude generated `samples/*.cs` files.

### Demos Working

```
codex run samples/hello.codex           → 25
codex run samples/factorial.codex       → 3628800
codex run samples/fibonacci.codex       → 6765
codex run samples/greeting.codex        → Hello, World!
codex run samples/prose-greeting.codex  → Hello, World!
codex check samples/arithmetic.codex    → ✓ 3 definitions, no errors
codex read samples/prose-greeting.codex → formatted prose output
codex parse samples/prose-greeting.codex → chapter/prose/notation structure
```

### Test Counts

| Project | Tests | Status | Delta |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Codex.Core.Tests | 16 | ✅ All pass | — |
| Codex.Syntax.Tests | 39 | ✅ All pass | +10 (prose parser) |
| Codex.Ast.Tests | 11 | ✅ All pass | — |
| Codex.Semantics.Tests | 10 | ✅ All pass | — |
| Codex.Types.Tests | 31 | ✅ All pass | +9 (integration) |
| **Total** | **107** | **✅ All pass** | **+19** |

## Architecture After This Iteration

### Prose-Mode Parsing

The prose-mode parser (`ProseParser`) operates at a higher level than the notation-mode parser:

```
Source (.codex)
    → ProseParser.IsProseDocument()   detect if "Chapter:" header present
    → ProseParser                     split into chapters, prose blocks, notation blocks
        → for each notation block:
            → Lexer + Parser           standard notation-mode parsing
    → DocumentNode                    unified CST with Chapters + Definitions
    → Desugarer                       (unchanged — uses document.Definitions)
    → ... rest of pipeline unchanged
```

For notation-only files, the existing `Lexer → Parser` path is used directly.

### Key Design Decisions Made

- **ProseParser is a separate class**, not a mode in the Lexer. Prose structure is detected by line-level indentation patterns; notation blocks are delegated to the existing Lexer+Parser. This avoids complicating the lexer with mode switching.
- **`DocumentNode` has both `Definitions` and `Chapters`**. For notation-only files, `Chapters` is empty. For prose files, `Definitions` is populated by collecting from all `NotationBlockNode`s. The rest of the pipeline (Desugarer, NameResolver, etc.) only uses `Definitions`.
- **Prose at 2-space indent, notation at 4+ spaces**. The `LooksLikeNotation` heuristic checks for `: `, ` = `, or `(` in indented lines.
- **`codex read` renders to terminal**. Chapters get `═══ Title ═══` headers, prose is indented, notation shows definition signatures.

## What's Next (Suggested for Iteration 5)

### Milestone 2 Gaps (Recommended Priority)
- [ ] Sum type (variant) definitions: `Result (a) = | Success (a) | Failure Text`
- [ ] Record type definitions: `Person = record { name : Text, age : Integer }`
- [ ] Pattern matching on sum types in the type checker
- [ ] Pattern matching exhaustiveness checking
- [ ] Proper sum type constructors in the type checker and lowering

### Milestone 4 Stretch
- [ ] Section headers within chapters (`Section: ...`)
- [ ] Prose template matching: "An X is a record containing:", "X is either:"
- [ ] The account module example from `NewRepository.txt` should parse
- [ ] Inline code references in prose (backtick-delimited)

### Quality
- [ ] Error recovery in ProseParser (currently stops on unexpected structure)
- [ ] Source span accuracy in ProseParser (notation block spans are relative to the block, not the original file)
- [ ] Additional integration tests for edge cases

### Known Limitations
- **No sum types or record types** in the type system yet
- **No effect system** — all functions are pure
- **ProseParser source spans** are offset relative to notation blocks, not the original file
- **`codex run`** shells out to `dotnet build` + `dotnet run` (~2s overhead)
- **Prose template matching** not implemented — prose is captured as raw text
- **`Codex.Proofs`** and **`Codex.Narration`** are still placeholder projects

## Environment Notes

- **Solution file**: `Codex.sln` (in repo root)
- **Build**: `dotnet build Codex.sln`
- **Test**: `dotnet test Codex.sln`
- **TreatWarningsAsErrors**: `true` — don't leave unused variables
- **No XML doc comments** — stripped and ruled out in `copilot-instructions.md`
- **Agent instructions**: `copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Contributing rules**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
